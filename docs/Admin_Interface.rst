ION Management Functions
========================

AS OF PYION 4.1.2, THE ADMIN MODULE IS DEPRECATED AND NO LONGER SUPPORTED

``Pyion`` offers a basic set of management functions, mostly in the context of the Bundle Protocol and Contact Graph Routing. Additional management functions can be developed on an ad-hoc basis as new features are requested, but they are not intended to replace the management functions being natively supported by ION (e.g., ``ionadmin``, ``bpadmin``, etc.). Furthermore, the maturity of these management functions is low.
